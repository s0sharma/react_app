LNch15.txt,Robustness and Resilience,"The study of robustness in networks is important because a thorough understanding of the behavior of certain classes of networks under failures and attacks may help to protect, for instance, communication networks like the Internet against assaults or to exploit weaknesses of metabolic networks in drug design. Examples for random and intentional component failures in real-world complex networks are, for instance, mutations in a cell, pharmaceutical or environmental stress on metabolic networks, router failures in the Internet, or intentional attacks on airline or highway networks."

Notions where density is a dominant aspect are of particular importance. Density has an outstanding relevance in social networks. A graph-theoretical group property is local if it is definable over subgraphs induced by the groups only."

Mandate - 1_ Network Science for the Web (1).pdf,Network Science intro,"Network Science is a study of networks and their dynamics to derive semantics latent in networks. Networks appears in all domains like airline networks, transport networks, energy grid networks etc. The structure of a network provides a number of semantic interpretations of its characteristics and the structure of the nodes can provide information like importance, influence, impact.

We use a graph representation of the network as the fundamental data structure. We understand various concepts like centrality, degree centrality, eccentricity, closeness, betweenness, closeness vitality, PagerRank."

NCMch7.txt,Evolutionary Game Theory,"In this chapter, on the other hand, we explore the notion of evolutionary game theory, which shows that the basic ideas of game theory can be applied even to situations in which no individual is overtly reasoning or even making explicit decisions. The key insight of evolutionary game theory is that many behaviors involve the interaction of multiple organisms in a population, and the success of any one of these organisms depends on how its behavior interacts with that of others. This approach opens the door to a natural game-theoretic analogy: an organism's genetically determined characteristics and behaviors are like its strategy in a game, its fitness is like its payoff, and this payoff depends on the strategies (characteristics) of the organisms with which it interacts."

This information is commonknowledge: each agent knows the structure, knows that each agent knows the structure, knows that other agents know that each agent knows the structure, and so on.What an agent does not know is the realizations of the state and of the private signals. One may assume that nature's probability distribution is known by all agents, but this assumption is not necessary."
