buyer may different valuation houses assume seller valuation house care receiving payment buyers define next price playoffs suppose seller put house sale offering sell price pi buyer j buy house seller price say buyer payoff valuation house minus amount money pay via pi given set prices buyer j want maximize payoff buy seller quantity via pi maximize following caveats call seller seller

set prices define seller preferred graph buyer seller simply constructing edge buyer preferred seller sellers edge buyer ha preferred seller fact figure b drawing seller preferred graph three indicated set prices simply say set price market clearing resulting seller preferred graph ha perfect matching way clearing market price feel bit good true seller set price right way interest self run course potentially bit coordination breaking tie buyer get others way claim different houses seen price achieved one small example fact something much general true existence clearing market prices set buyer valuations exists set clearing market prices consider another natural question relationship clearing market price social welfare fact something strong said well clearing market price seller buyer matching problem always provide socially optimal outcomes optimal clearing market prices set clearing market prices perfect matching resulting seller preferred graph ha maximum total valuation assignment seller buyers argument follows consider set clearing market prices let perfect matching seller preferred graph consider total payoff matching defined simply sum buyer payoff gets since buyer grabbing house maximize payoff individually ha matching market maximum total payoff assignment house buyers another important way thinking optimal clearing market prices turn essentially equivalent formulation described suppose instead thinking total valuation matching think total playoff received participant market seller buyers buyer payoff defined valuation house get minus price pays therefore matching total playoff seller simply equal sum price since get paid doesnt matter buyer pay seller argued total playoff buyer equal total valuation matching minus sum prices therefore total playoff participant seller buyer exactly equal total valuation matching point price detract total buyer payoff exactly amount contribute total seller payoff hence sum price cancel completely calculation therefore maximize total playoff participants want price matching lead maximum total valuation achieved using clearing market price perfect matching resulting seller preferred graph optimal clearing market price equivalent version set market clearing prices perfect matching resulting seller preferred graph produce maximum possible sum playoff seller buyers constructing set

individual belief endogenous whether come true depends aggregate behavior individual alternately many people expect large membership social networking site expect large payoff result many people join payoff indeed high different example setting market buyer sellers suppose people expect used car offered sale uniformly low quality one willing pay high price used car result one good used car offer sale since would get price worth fact market contain quality low used car sale hand people expect used car reasonable average quality may willing pay price high enough induce seller good bad used car put market concept wa central discussion network effect chapter see example car used market information may le accurate priori reason suppose large fraction population intrinsically better informed large fraction case car used market however seller used car know something car quality potential buyer know inherent feature market works asymmetric information market used cars seller know buyer seller cars market health insurance hand buyer insurance often know seller value market demon good health insurance purchased since buyer may well know inherent health risk company offering insurance stock market either side transaction could information future value stock known side transaction feature ignored earlier discussion stock market considering role asymmetric information well follow similar strategy first developing case car used market simple stylized example showing principle apply range complex fundamental markets leading example paper wa market used car called market demons let suppose two type used cars good car bad cars buyer know quality seller car aware fact seller know quality cars market participant buyer seller value used car differently cid cid seller value good car bad car seller good car would willing sell price least lower price would prefer hold onto similarly seller bad car would willing sell price least lower price would prefer hold onto buyer value good car bad car value interpreted buyer reservation price cars thus buyer would willing buy car known good car price bad car price note assumed type car buyer place value value common value seller place market information let suppose fraction g used car good cars hence fraction g bad cars well also assume everyone know g finally let suppose buyer used car buyer sellers since seller ha one used car case since buyer sellers every car could sold buyer would expect observe different price good car bad cars price good car clearly price range good car sold similarly price bad car since buyer sellers buyer able purchase car would expect price type car bid upper limit range prices price good car price bad car market asymmetric information happens buyer cannot tell advance purchase type car buying since car indistinguishable buyers one price used car car trade trade price given random aspect outcome need consider buyer evaluate risk considering better horse races keep analysis simple current case car used market assume buyer care risk simply evaluate expected value used car considering let consider market look like case buyer cant distinguish among different type cars first fraction good car population used car sale number h fraction h might g fraction good car overall car used population might since seller good used car necessarily put car sale thus order buyer know much willing pay used car need prediction value h put u domain fulfilling self expectation equilibrium similarly saw discussing network effect chapter added issue information asymmetry need look shared expectation h buyer fulfilling self buyer expects fraction h car market good indeed h fraction car market good one candidate equilibrium form h g would correct prediction buyer seller indeed choose offer car sale occurs plug h g equation see buyer would willing pay g car let call price p prediction h g correct must case price p seller good car seller bad car offer sale seller good car would offer sale p provided p g equivalently g p seller bad car would also happy make sale g fulfilling self expectation equilibrium car offered sale easy see seller good car would sell let consider happens g could fulfilling self expect ton equilibrium h g car offered sale g price buyer would willing pay believe car offered sale using equation p g however owner good car would willing sell price g keep market meaning h fraction good car market would equal g case cannot fulfilling self expectation equilibrium h g however value g always fulfilling self expectation equilibrium h bad car sold see note buyer expect bad car market willing pay car price seller bad car would willing sell seller good car would market would consist bad cars thus fulfilling self expectation equilibrium h summarize value g two possible fulfilling self expectation equilibrium one car sold one bad car sold g hand equilibrium one bad car sold example good bad car illustrates basic idea equilibrium asymmetric information work doesnt fully capture possible extent market failure bad effect get explore let consider example three type used cars good cars bad cars demons good car bad car still play basic role previous example whereas demon completely worthless buyer sellers market demon offered sale fact functioning market since consists opportunity trade item value market information example three type used cars let suppose following cid cid cid cid third one car good third one bad third one demons seller value good car bad car demon buyer value good car bad car demon buyer used cars complete information would expect good bad car sold price respectively since buyer sellers buyer value type car least much seller whether demon sold question buyer seller indifference since worth everyone asymmetric information need consider possible fulfilling self expectation equilibrium three candidate equilibrium car offered sale b bad car demon offered sale c demon offered sale note option c represents complete failure market since item market would value let consider turn see actually possible first suppose buyer expect car market expected value car buyer would le value seller good car place cars would put market meaning expectation would borne happens b alternately suppose buyer expect bad car demon market expected value car buyer would le value seller bad car place bad cars would put market meaning expectation would borne happens equilibrium c finally previous example two type cars clearly equilibrium buyer expect demon sold case expected value car willing pay market consist completely demons notice market ha submerged kind chain reaction good car cant survive market frequency bad car demons even without good cars bad car cant survive market frequency demons asymmetric information market summary ingredient market demons next section well take lesson car used example apply market much larger fundamental ii given level quality buyer value item quality least much

willing accept firm offers fact worker would market words equilibrium productive worker apply job firm good used cars driven market high frequency unproductive workers example asymmetric information play important role market health insurance group people risk category based medical history within group individual know history behave future insurance company knows ingredient market demons individual given risk category le costly sure insurance company cannot market information reliably make grained fine distinctions case car used market market health insurance unravel point one buy insurance course whether actually happens depends actual numbers much cost provide insurance much people value insurance compared alternatives information asymmetry focused market health insurance leads case used car employment type adverse selection another type information asymmetry occurs market health insurance far ignored discussion action observable insurance company new source
